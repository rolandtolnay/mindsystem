### [Category 3]

- [ ] **[CAT]-02**: [Requirement description]

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |

| [Feature] | [Why excluded] |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated by create-roadmap.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| AUTH-01 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| AUTH-02 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| AUTH-03 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| AUTH-04 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| [REQ-ID] | Phase [N] | Pending |

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: [X] total
- Mapped to phases: [Y]
- Unmapped: [Z] ⚠️

<guidelines>

**Requirement Format:**
- ID: `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, CONTENT-02, SOCIAL-03)
- Description: User-centric, testable, atomic
- Checkbox: Only for v1 requirements (v2 are not yet actionable)

**Categories:**
- Derive from research FEATURES.md categories
- Keep consistent with domain conventions
- Typical: Authentication, Content, Social, Notifications, Moderation, Payments, Admin

**v1 vs v2:**
- v1: Committed scope, will be in roadmap phases
- v2: Acknowledged but deferred, not in current roadmap
- Moving v2 → v1 requires roadmap update

**Out of Scope:**
- Explicit exclusions with reasoning
- Prevents "why didn't you include X?" later
- Anti-features from research belong here with warnings

**Traceability:**
- Empty initially, populated by create-roadmap
- Each requirement maps to exactly one phase
- Unmapped requirements = roadmap gap (error in create-roadmap)

**Status Values:**
- Pending: Not started
- In Progress: Phase is active
- Complete: Requirement verified
- Blocked: Waiting on external factor

</guidelines>

<evolution>
Update requirements after phase completion: mark requirements Complete, update traceability status. After roadmap changes: verify all v1 requirements still mapped, add/move requirements as scope changes. A requirement is "Complete" when implemented, verified, and committed.
</evolution>

# Requirements: CommunityApp

**Defined:** 2025-01-14
**Core Value:** Users can share and discuss content with people who share their interests

## v1 Requirements

### Authentication

## v2 Requirements

### Notifications

- **NOTF-01**: User receives in-app notifications
- **NOTF-02**: User receives email for new followers

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time chat | High complexity, not core to community value |
| Video posts | Storage/bandwidth costs, defer to v2+ |
| OAuth login | Email/password sufficient for v1 |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| AUTH-01 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| AUTH-02 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| PROF-01 | Phase 2 | Pending |
| PROF-02 | Phase 2 | Pending |

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: 18 total
- Mapped to phases: 18
- Unmapped: 0 ✓
