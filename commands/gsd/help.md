# GSD Command Reference

**GSD** (Get Shit Done) creates hierarchical project plans optimized for solo agentic development with Claude Code.

## Quick Start

1. `/gsd:new-project` - Initialize project with brief
2. `/gsd:research-project` - (optional) Research domain ecosystem
3. `/gsd:define-requirements` - Scope v1/v2/out of scope
4. `/gsd:create-roadmap` - Create roadmap and phases
5. `/gsd:plan-phase 1` - Create detailed plan for first phase
6. `/gsd:execute-phase 1` - Execute with parallel agents

## Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Check for updates periodically:

```
/gsd:whats-new
```

Shows what changed since your installed version. Update with:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
```

## Core Workflow

```
Initialization → Planning → Execution → Milestone Completion
```

### Project Initialization

**`/gsd:new-project`**
Initialize new project with brief and configuration.

- Creates `.planning/PROJECT.md` (vision and requirements)
- Creates `.planning/config.json` (workflow mode)
- Asks for workflow mode (interactive/yolo) upfront
- Commits initialization files to git

Usage: `/gsd:new-project`

**`/gsd:research-project`**
Research domain ecosystem before creating roadmap.

- Spawns parallel agents to investigate stack, features, architecture, pitfalls
- Creates `.planning/research/` with ecosystem knowledge
- Recommended for best results; skip only if you need speed over thoroughness

Usage: `/gsd:research-project`

**`/gsd:define-requirements`**
Define what "done" looks like with checkable requirements.

- Scopes features as v1, v2, or out of scope
- Works with or without prior research
- Creates `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` with traceability

Usage: `/gsd:define-requirements`

**`/gsd:create-roadmap`**
Create roadmap and state tracking for initialized project.

- Creates `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (phase breakdown)
- Creates `.planning/STATE.md` (project memory)
- Creates `.planning/phases/` directories

Usage: `/gsd:create-roadmap`

**`/gsd:map-codebase`**
Map an existing codebase for brownfield projects.

- Analyzes codebase with parallel Explore agents
- Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 focused documents
- Covers stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns
- Use before `/gsd:new-project` on existing codebases

Usage: `/gsd:map-codebase`

### Phase Planning

**`/gsd:discuss-phase <number>`**
Help articulate your vision for a phase before planning.

- Captures how you imagine this phase working

**`/gsd:research-phase <number>`**
Comprehensive ecosystem research for niche/complex domains.

- Discovers standard stack, architecture patterns, pitfalls
- Creates RESEARCH.md with "how experts build this" knowledge
- Use for 3D, games, audio, shaders, ML, and other specialized domains
- Goes beyond "which library" to ecosystem knowledge

Usage: `/gsd:research-phase 3`

**`/gsd:list-phase-assumptions <number>`**
See what Claude is planning to do before it starts.

- Shows Claude's intended approach for a phase
- Lets you course-correct if Claude misunderstood your vision
- No files created - conversational output only

Usage: `/gsd:list-phase-assumptions 3`

**`/gsd:plan-phase <number>`**
Create detailed execution plan for a specific phase.

- Generates `.planning/phases/XX-phase-name/XX-YY-PLAN.md`
- Breaks phase into concrete, actionable tasks
- Includes verification criteria and success measures
- Multiple plans per phase supported (XX-01, XX-02, etc.)

Usage: `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
Result: Creates `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

### Execution

**`/gsd:execute-plan <path>`**
Execute a single PLAN.md file.

- Runs plan tasks sequentially
- Creates SUMMARY.md after completion

**`/gsd:execute-phase <phase-number>`**
Execute all unexecuted plans in a phase with parallel background agents.

- Analyzes plan dependencies and spawns independent plans concurrently
- Use when phase has 2+ plans and you want "walk away" execution
- Respects max_concurrent_agents from config.json

Usage: `/gsd:execute-phase 5`

Options (via `.planning/config.json` parallelization section):
- `max_concurrent_agents`: Limit parallel agents (default: 3)
- `skip_checkpoints`: Skip human checkpoints in background (default: true)
- `min_plans_for_parallel`: Minimum plans to trigger parallelization (default: 2)

### Verification

**`/gsd:check-phase <number>`**

## Workflow Modes

Set during `/gsd:new-project`:

**Interactive Mode**

- Confirms each major decision
- Pauses at checkpoints for approval
- More guidance throughout

**YOLO Mode**

- Auto-approves most decisions
- Executes plans without confirmation
- Only stops for critical checkpoints

Change anytime by editing `.planning/config.json`

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**

```
/gsd:new-project                 # Extract your idea through questions
/gsd:research-project            # (recommended) Research domain ecosystem
/gsd:define-requirements         # Scope v1/v2/out of scope
/gsd:create-roadmap              # Create phases mapped to requirements
/gsd:plan-phase 1                # Create detailed plan
/gsd:execute-phase 1             # Execute with parallel agents
```

**Resuming work after a break:**

```
/gsd:progress  # See where you left off and continue
```

**Verifying before execution (optional):**

```
/gsd:plan-phase 5
/gsd:check-phase 5    # Verify plans before committing
/gsd:execute-phase 5
```

**Adding urgent mid-milestone work:**

```
/gsd:insert-phase 5 "Critical security fix"
/gsd:plan-phase 5.1
/gsd:execute-phase 5.1
```

**Completing a milestone:**

```
/gsd:audit-milestone 1.0.0       # Verify before completing
/gsd:complete-milestone 1.0.0    # Archive and tag
/gsd:discuss-milestone           # Gather context for next
/gsd:new-milestone "v1.1 Features"
```

**Closing gaps from audit:**

```
/gsd:audit-milestone 1.0.0       # Finds gaps
/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps         # Creates phases to fix them
/gsd:plan-phase 6                # Plan first gap closure phase
/gsd:execute-phase 6
/gsd:audit-milestone 1.0.0       # Re-audit when done
```

**Capturing ideas during work:**

```
/gsd:add-todo                    # Capture from conversation context
/gsd:add-todo Fix modal z-index  # Capture with explicit description
/gsd:check-todos                 # Review and work on todos
/gsd:check-todos api             # Filter by area
```

**Debugging an issue:**

```
/gsd:debug "form submission fails silently"  # Start debug session
# ... investigation happens, context fills up ...
/clear
/gsd:debug                                    # Resume from where you left off
```

## Getting Help

- Read `.planning/PROJECT.md` for project vision
- Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current context
- Check `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase status
- Run `/gsd:progress` to check where you're up to
